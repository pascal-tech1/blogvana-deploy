		content:
			'<p>This new monthly series is dedicated to helping mentors and mentees connect with one another. Many of you have requested a space like this from DEV and we\'ve decided that a regular monthly discussion thread would offer a great option for interested folks.</p>\n\n<p>The DEV Community is made up of a wide variety of developers who are at different points in their careers with separate skill sets and specialties. We\'re constantly sharing our experiences and learning together in public, so it feels natural to open up a space for mentors and potential mentees to meet &amp; mingle, discuss what they\'re offering or hoping to get from mentorship, and plan their next steps.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="heres-how-it-works" href="#heres-how-it-works">\n  </a>\n  Here\'s How It Works\n</h2>\n\n<p>Below, we\'ll offer some guidance for how to approach this thread from both a mentor and a mentee\'s perspective.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="guidance-for-mentors" href="#guidance-for-mentors">\n  </a>\n  Guidance for Mentors 🍎\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you\'re a mentor and plan on using this thread to talk about your experience and what you can provide mentorship-wise, you\'ve come to the right place. Also, thank you... we appreciate you offering to help others in our community!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: If you\'re offering a paid-for service, we ask that you please be upfront about that in your message.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We recommend sharing a message about yourself that includes the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Your experience as a developer and as a mentor.</strong> If it\'s your first time offering mentorship, that\'s okay; please just be honest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What you\'re able to offer.</strong> For example: share your preferred method of communication and how much estimated time you can provide on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why you\'re doing this.</strong> Perhaps you remember being a beginner and would like to help someone out. Maybe you run a supportive Discord channel. Or, maybe it\'s part of your career in DevRel.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How folks can connect with you.</strong> You could provide contact details, point to your website, link to your socials/Discord channel/etc. — just give folks a way to get in touch.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="guidance-for-mentees" href="#guidance-for-mentees">\n  </a>\n  Guidance for Mentees ✨\n</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks for coming here to find a mentor and/or to put yourself out there as a potential mentee. We hope that this thread helps to connect you with somebody or group of folks in the DEV Community who can offer you guidance and assistance via mentorship.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: We do not endorse every person who lists themselves as a mentor in this thread. Remember, this is an open thread, so please be cautious about sharing your personal details. If you see someone whose behavior or services seem suspicious, please don\'t hesitate to <a href="https://dev.to/report-abuse">report them to us</a>.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We recommend responding to a mentor who has let a message below and/or sharing a message about yourself that includes the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Your current experience level as a developer.</strong> If you\'re just beginning and/or in early learning stages, that\'s absolutely okay!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What your personal goals are.</strong> These can be long-term and aspirational, e.g. I want to become a professional web developer. They can also be more short-term and specific, e.g. I want to learn best practices for naming models in Ruby.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What your personal commitment looks like.</strong> Can you meet up multiple times a week, once a week, once a month? Are you full-time job searching or currently working somewhere else? How much time do you expect to spend on this?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How folks can connect with you.</strong> You could let a mentor know that you plan on contacting them. And/or you could provide contact details, point to your website, socials, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="match-on" href="#match-on">\n  </a>\n  Match on 🤝\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0UeqE7zM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm3gu9w4circ89ykdzb6.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0UeqE7zM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm3gu9w4circ89ykdzb6.gif" alt="A scene from Nope where the brother and sister do a really fast-paced, frantic hand-slapping handshake" loading="lazy" width="480" height="270" data-animated="true"></a></p>\n\n<p>Alright, now that y\'all know how this works, feel free to drop your details below and let folks get to know you!</p>\n\n',

			'<p>I always make an annual plan. I think it\'s good to have a goal in mind, even if the path to it is the really important thing, to be active and consistent.

		title: "Introducing gdocweb",
		description:
			"This Post is a Google Docs Document…   Note: This post was originally published here.  Yes....",
		content:
			'<h2>\n  <a name="this-post-is-a-google-docs-document" href="#this-post-is-a-google-docs-document">\n  </a>\n  This Post is a Google Docs Document…\n</h2>\n\n<p>Note: This post was <a href="https://blog.gdocweb.com/introducing-gdocweb.html">originally published here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes. This post started off as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs document</a> that you can see by clicking that link. I’m assuming you’re seeing it on the web which is where it’s supposed to be. It was translated to a web page seamlessly using <a href="https://gdocweb.com/">gdocweb</a>. Gdocweb converts Google Docs to websites or more importantly to GitHub Pages. GitHub provides free website hosting, including custom domains. That means you end up with a no-strings-attached website.</p>\n\n<p>This is pretty convenient as we don’t have to write HTML or maintain files on GitHub. We can collaborate using Google Docs and get a fully functional site.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="how-does-it-work" href="#how-does-it-work">\n  </a>\n  How does it Work?\n</h2>\n\n<p>In order to build this blog website we need to first create a few Google Docs documents. You can look for inspiration in the templates section on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">gdocweb.com</a>. Since this is a blog site I will create two documents. The first is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">this document that you’re reading right now</a>, it’s the content of the blog. The <a href="https://blog.gdocweb.com/index.html">second document is the homepage of the blog</a> which will  include the latest entries and links to the full posts. To link I can create a link to a web page as usual, or to another Google Docs document. <strong>Important:</strong> link translation will only work for documents that are in the current set of exported documents. If you link to a document that isn’t a part of the site it would remain a link to a Google Docs document. Furthermore, there’s a special case of linking to the current page. Those links aren’t translated since it’s assumed that you might want to provide readers with the ability to edit/review the actual document.</p>\n\n<p>This is also a good time to <a href="https://github.com/signup">sign up to GitHub</a> if you don’t have an account yet. It’s the site that lets us host the website for free.</p>\n\n<p>Once we create some documents we need to login on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">gdocweb.com</a> and most crucially, approve the permissions to access both documents and drive. This is essential to scan the files and is 100% read-only. No data from your documents is retained or saved into disk. See the image below to understand the permission dialog from Google. Also notice that I just dragged this image into Google Docs and it’s now seamlessly a part of this website and blog post…</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VWwxApvF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmsgw2zejx6r47vdp613.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VWwxApvF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmsgw2zejx6r47vdp613.jpg" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="938"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong> When placing images into a document I would suggest checking their file size and trying to keep it below 200kb. Otherwise the performance of your website might suffer.</p>\n\n<p>Once we go through that step we are faced with a list of our documents. You can use your browser\'s search function to find the relevant entry. Once there we can select the documents we want to include in the site. Notice that your selections are saved and will be shown the next time around.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M5uf9duP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt19w4t8296ystq7vh3m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M5uf9duP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt19w4t8296ystq7vh3m.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="479"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this case we need the index page and the first blog post. In the future we will need to add any new blog post we write. You can drag and drop the documents to arrange their order. You can hide them from navigation or make them a submenu. The first entry will always serve as an <em>index.html</em> file, the file that will be shown on the root directory.</p>\n\n<p>Once we made the selection and arranged everything we press next. At this point we are presented with the themes page where we can choose the theme and the menu style. For menu the options are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Horizontal - a standard pull down menu bar.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vertical Sidebar</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this case I picked the vertical sidebar which will provide us with a list of all the posts as we write more of them. We can also pick the theme. I picked the “Basic” theme, we’re working on additional theme options to provide more choices.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v2AcgE-S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hjl1siouw8ty4qwt3ach.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v2AcgE-S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hjl1siouw8ty4qwt3ach.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="705"></a></p>\n\n<p>The next step is “Authorize GitHub Access” which is required to save the generated website. This step happens only once, after you approve access to GitHub you will be redirected to a page where you can select the target repository. Since this is the first time I’m running the wizard I typed in a new repository name, after the first time you can pick the same repository and the process will be smoother as you won’t have to follow some of the additional steps.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vXCvJSMW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fn7th8o2x89ki7awn7ns.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vXCvJSMW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fn7th8o2x89ki7awn7ns.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="412"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Finish button updates or creates the website for you. Once it finishes you will be presented with the final step. If this isn’t the first time you’re creating this website then your site will be up in a couple of minutes. If it is the first time you’re running this process then there are a couple of additional steps.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the GitHub project for this blog <a href="https://github.com/shai-almog/GdocwebBlog">right here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UsoAGbXv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xna730j79lkm6dcg9q5x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UsoAGbXv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xna730j79lkm6dcg9q5x.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="470"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="only-on-the-first-time" href="#only-on-the-first-time">\n  </a>\n  Only on the First Time\n</h2>\n\n<p>You need to click the “here” button to go to the settings section on GitHub in the newly created repository. Which looks like the following picture.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4gwjyiE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nrhz96xrsqsuovzmb585.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4gwjyiE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nrhz96xrsqsuovzmb585.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="575"></a></p>\n\n<p>Under the branch section we need to click the combo box that says “None” and select “<strong>main</strong>” (or master for older repositories). Then select <strong>root</strong> on the next combo and click <strong>Save</strong> as shown in the following image.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--REd0ukEk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uutuvt9i9o8sgxzxhhvk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--REd0ukEk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uutuvt9i9o8sgxzxhhvk.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="594"></a></p>\n\n<p>Once this is done it will take a couple of minutes to deploy the website to a free URL which you can see by clicking the “View Your Site” button.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="extra-credit-domain" href="#extra-credit-domain">\n  </a>\n  Extra Credit - Domain\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the cool features of GitHub is that it lets you bind a domain (a URL name like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">gdocweb.com</a>) to a website for free. In this case I want to bind <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oF3FdtK1NoLPWO5aCfcsSct5xMK5mgSgEkDt6m_1pvo/edit?usp=sharing">blog.gdocweb.com</a> to the new blog. We can do that with the following steps. We go back to the GitHub settings page we saw previously as shown in the following image:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0poZ58FI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmf04ypn4xn0kcniqfp2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0poZ58FI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmf04ypn4xn0kcniqfp2.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="206"></a></p>\n\n<p>Notice there’s a link on that page to a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">tutorial on domain binding</a>. I won’t repeat it here but the gist of it is that you need to add a CNAME entry for the new domain. In this case on cloudflare I used the following to bind the domain. Notice I disabled the proxy functionality as it isn’t needed for GitHub.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FSPJcgg8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jado5zbf1cn66jjno9f9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FSPJcgg8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jado5zbf1cn66jjno9f9.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="188"></a></p>\n\n<p>Notice that this means you can only have one domain per GitHub account since this isn’t project specific. Once this is saved I can type my new domain in GitHub and save. Notice that this might take a while since HTTPS certificate generation isn’t immediate.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7olemzdZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ze2c36rfy2f2mkpdayn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7olemzdZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ze2c36rfy2f2mkpdayn.png" alt="Image description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="290"></a></p>\n\n<p>DNS sometimes takes a while to complete, if you’re confident the settings are correct click retry a couple of times.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="future-improvements" href="#future-improvements">\n  </a>\n  Future Improvements\n</h2>\n\n<p>gdocweb was designed as a general purpose tool for generating websites. Not as a blogging platform. As such it is lacking in many regards:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No commenting system.</p></li>\n<li><p>We have to generate our own blog index.</p></li>\n<li><p>No search or elaborate functionality.</p></li>\n<li><p>Themes are still rudimentary.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would like to improve on all of these when moving forward with this tool. If you feel strongly about any of these let us know on our social channels. This will help us define priorities for the basic issues.</p>\n\n',

			'<p>since Chat GPT was Released a lot of people started to say "AI Will Take Our jobs"<br>\ndevelopers laughed and said "Okay We Are Irreplaceable". but also voices have arise saying "AI Now can writes code so you are replaceable too"<br>\nSo the question here "IS AI Really Dangerous For Developers ?"<br>\nin my humble opinion "NO It\'s not" at least in mean time</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="but-why-do-i-think-that" href="#but-why-do-i-think-that">\n  </a>\n  but why do I think that?\n</h2>\n\n<p>I think the whole problem started when the word "AI" became Mainstream as AI has been there for ages and no one cared about it.<br>\nbut when Chat GPT released it allowed normal people to use AI and see how far has AI been developed and a lot of rumors were spread even my father\'s friend who have never used a computer told him "your son is going to loos his job".<br>\nbut some expertise have also the same opinion , in fact they are influenced by mainstream opinion or they are just saying that so they can go viral and become celebrities (since that what\'s people want to here)</p>\n\n<p>most of these people justify their opinion by the fact that AI now can write code, but my question is do a developer only code?<br>\nabsolutely no, the most powerful skill of a developer is "The Ability to develop a solution" it\'s not just about writing code for it\'s actually it\'s the easiest part.</p>\n\n<p>and also AI Doesn\'t Create a code it\'s more like collecting other humans\' code and putting them together <br>\n(yes just like what we do 😂)</p>\n\n<p>so finally, do we really need to panic about losing our jobs for AI?<br>\nwe already lose it for inflation, so calm down and think about ho to develop your skills in such fast paced domain.</p>\n\n',

			'<p>I\'m working on a project which has radio buttons to select between Metric and Imperial measurement systems and show inputs based on selection and the default checked button is Metric. Then I came across this weird behavior of firefox not returning to the default checked button on page reload!<br>\nI found out it\'s a known feature/bug on firefox as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio">MDN</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unlike other browsers, Firefox by default <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing">persists the dynamic checked state</a> of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And if I got it right the only solution is to use <code>autocomplete="off"</code> attribute either on the <code>form</code> or on the radio inputs themselves. I chose the latter as I don\'t want to disable the autocomplete feature for the whole form!<br>\nI was relieved until the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">W3C Validator</a> yelled at me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error: Attribute autocomplete is only allowed when the input type is color, date, datetime-local, email, hidden, month, number, password, range, search, tel, text, time, url, or week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was like<br>\n<a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/9Vx51uYaQasyCSkNlx/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/9Vx51uYaQasyCSkNlx/giphy.gif" alt="I\'m not a criminal" loading="lazy" width="480" height="269" data-animated="true"></a></p>\n\n<p>And after a lot of searching and thinking I ended up checking on every page-load is imperial radio checked? and if so uncheck and recheck the default one!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you firefox what a great feature!</p>\n\n<p>cover image source: <a href="https://thequotes.me/2021/11/05/its-a-bug/">The quotes - It’s a bug</a></p>\n\n',
